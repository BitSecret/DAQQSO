The prototype support system of the multi-criteria decision-making method based on **D**ouble **A**ggregation of **Q**ualitative and **Q**uantitative criteria, **S**ubjective and **O**bjective data.  

# Introduction
The eye-tracking and electroencephalogram data have been viewed as effective supplements to subjective reporting to guide the product appearance design. We propose different methods to determine subjective and objective weights of criteria based on the self-reporting, eye-tracking and electroencephalogram data for product appearance design evaluation.  

# Project structure
The project structure is shown below:

`java` is the java implementation code of the DAQQSO. Where `code` is the Java source code, `data` is the program input data.  
`python` is related Python code and data, using Monte Carlo method to generate simulated data.  
`QT` is a prototype system with a GUI, implemented using QT technology. This folder includes source code and input data.
